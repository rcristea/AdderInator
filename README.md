# AdderInator
The app is used to find a which balances add up to the target balance. (Basically Two-Sum GUI with extra steps)

### To Launch the App
1. GOTO \Number Adder Inator Inator 2000\Number Adder Inator Inator 2000\bin\Debug
2. Open Number Adder Inator Inator 2000.exe

### Bugs
1. Does not currently support multiple subsets that may add up to the target. The app will just highlight all
the numbers that are included in any subset that adds up to the target. Support will be added.
